    <b>What we log:</b>
  </p>
  <p>We use Google Analytics to collect usage info. Google Analytics collects data such as how long you spend in Beaker, what browser you're using, and your geographic region.</p>
  <p>In addition to the standard Google Analytics collection, we're logging how many times you run cells in each language and what types of notebooks you open (local .bkr file, remote .ipynb, et cetera).</p>
  <p>
    <b>What we <i>don't</i> log:</b>
  </p>
  <p>We will never log any of the code you run or the names of your notebooks.</p>
  <p>Please see our <a target="_blank" href="http://beakernotebook.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> for more information.</p>
